            <h1 class="header">Education</h1>
            <p>I attended secondary school called Colaiste Na Sceilge which was located in Cahersiveen, Co. Kerry. I mostly obtained my artistic and design skills from choosing an art subject, I've gotten a merit on my art class. We learned about on how to sketch an object infront of us, sketch characters, create designs and alternative designs, shading, painting, watercolouring, stippling, lino art, paper mache and clay sculpturing. I have also attended college named Kerry College which is located in Tralee, Co. Kerry. I choose the games design course to help me in learning more about how it's like to work inside a proper game company environment, working with really great applications and tools to also create interesting, creative and immersive designs. </p>
